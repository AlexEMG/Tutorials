Collection of some teaching materials... 

These materials are for a [guest lecture on neural networks](https://github.com/AlexEMG/Tutorials.git), a course at Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School organzied by Bruno Boivin and Rafael Gonzalez Cano. I will also post the slides afterwards.
